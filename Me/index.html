        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>I am a technology enthusiast, with a desire to learn and utilize my skills in developing scalable, flexible, easily maintainable, readily available, effortlessly extensible, highly secure applications. I have an OCD ( :P ) while coding that prevents me from writing spaghetti code. I enjoy paired programming and strongly believe that this practice greatly influences younger developers, like myself to learn swiftly.</p>
        
        <p>I am a goal oriented person and my current five-year goal is to become a great mobile application developer and acquire sufficient knowledge for my next five-year goal. A master’s degree in software engineering has not quenched my desire to learn, Pluralsight, Sololearn, and other online tutorials have kept me busy ever since I graduated.</p>
        
        <p>I am also a mechanical engineer who years ago designed a plumber’s block/screw jack using CAD software, performed static and dynamic analysis on aircraft structures using complex analysis software, built RC machines, designed and modelled aerodynamic wings using high density foam and a certified CATIA designer.</p>
        
        <p>I am always open for a friendly conversation, culture exchange, political debate, technology sharing any project related to information technology. If it is something that I am not aware of, then I thank you for introducing it to me. Please feel free to contact me on any queries.</p>
